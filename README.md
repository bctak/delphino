# C_static_analysis

# The project to analyze C code and extract system calls used by the program
## Overview
This project extracts libc functions using Clang and libc symbols, identifies the relationship between libc functions and system calls, and ultimately extracts system calls from C code. In the future, system call information can be used for security, program structure analysis, and other purposes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Clang:** Clang must be installed on the PC to analyze C code.
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install clang
```

### Usage

#### 1. Static analysis program ( not completed )

```
cd C_static_analysis/src/
python3 static_analysis.py [c source code name]
```

Pass the filename of the C code to be analyzed as the first argument. As a result, a call graph of glibc functions used in the C code will be displayed.

#### 2. Program that converts glibc functions to system calls.

```
cd C_static_analysis/src/
python3 glibc_syscall.py [-l] [-o {json,plain}] [call graph file name] [glibc function name] 
```
The -l option print all glibc functions and exit
- There is no need to specify the call graph file name and glibc function name.

The -o option specifies the output format to be displayed
- json or plain (default plain)

The call graph file name refers to a file in the callgraph directory
- This uses the call graph generated by c2c (https://github.com/shamedgh/c2c).
- Other call graphs with the same format can also be used

The glibc function name specifies the name of the glibc function to be converted into system calls

##### Example
```
cd C_static_analysis/example/
python3 glibc_syscall.py -o json glibc.callgraph printf 
```

#### 3. Program to extract glibc functions used in C code

```
cd C_static_analysis/src/
python3 extract_glibc.py [c source code name]
```
Pass the filename of the C code to be analyzed as the first argument. As a result, the glibc functions used in the C code will be displayed.

##### Example
```
cd C_static_analysis/example/
python3 extract_glibc.py dirtycred.c
```
